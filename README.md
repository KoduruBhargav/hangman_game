This Hangman game is a simple word-guessing game where the player has a limited number of lives to guess the correct word. The player inputs a letter, and if the letter is present in the word, it is revealed in the word display. Otherwise, the player loses a life. The game continues until the player either guesses the entire word or loses all lives.
It includes error handling for duplicate guesses, dynamically updates the guessed word, and visually represents the hangman stages. To enhance the game, you could add additional word categories, improve user interaction, or implement a graphical interface.
